\subsection{Answer the following without typing the commands into R. Use {\tt ?} if you're not sure what the object is or what the function does.}  

\begin{enumerate}[{1.1}.1]
\item What is 
<<quiet=T,eval=F>>=
length(letters)
@
{\color{red} 26}
%\vspace{9 mm}
\item What is
<<quiet=T,eval=F>>=
length(letters == LETTERS)
@
{\color{red} 26}
%\vspace{9 mm}
\item What is
<<quiet=T,eval=F>>=
which(letters %in% c("a", "d"))
@
{\color{red} 1, 4}
%\vspace{9 mm}
\item What is
<<quiet=T,eval=F>>=
which(c("a", 7, "d") %in% letters)
@
{\color{red} 1, 3}
%\vspace{9 mm}
\item What is
<<quiet=T,eval=F>>=
letters[LETTERS > "W"]
@
{\color{red} x, y, z}
%\vspace{9 mm}
\item What is
<<quiet=T,eval=F>>=
letters[!LETTERS > "C"]
@
{\color{red} a, b, c}
%\vspace{9 mm}
\item What is
<<quiet=T,eval=F>>=
seq(from = 1, to = 20, by = 3)
@
{\color{red} 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19}
%\vspace{9 mm}
\item Why is {\tt x} filled in the way it is? Hint: read about the arguments for {\tt matrix}!
<<quiet=T>>=
x <- matrix(8:11, nrow = 6, ncol = 4)
x
@
\noindent {\color{red} {\tt x} looks this way because we defined the number of rows to be 6 and the number of columns to be 4, the default {\tt byrow} is FALSE so the array is filled columnwise, and the numbers {\tt 8:11} are repeated until the array is filled.}

\item What are 
<<quite=T,eval=F>>=
x + 4
x + x
2 * x
x / c(2, 3, 4, 5)
x[, 3] + 2 * x[, 2]
nrow(x)
x[x[, 3] > 10, ]
@
\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{$\cdot$}
{\color{red} 
\begin{itemize}
  \item 4 added to each value of {\tt x}
  \item 2 multiplied by each value of {\tt x}
  \item 2 multiplied by each value of {\tt x}
  \item columns of x are divided by the vector c(2, 3, 4, 5); so the first 4 rows will be divided by 2, 3, 4 and 5 respectively. Then the vector is recycled so that the fith and sixth rows are divided by 2 and 3. R then proceeds tp the second column, dividing the first and second row by 4 and 5, and so on.
  \item a single vector with values from the third column of x added to two times the second column of x
  \item 6
  \item the 4th row of x, since it's the only row where the third column is greater than 10
\end{itemize}}

\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Use R to answer the following.}


\begin{enumerate}[{1.2}.1]
 \item Create a vector (using {\tt c()}) called {\tt a} (i.e. assign it to an object called {\tt a}) with four elements which are the integers 5 to 8 (inclusive).
{\color{red} 
<<>>=
a <- 5:8
@
}
 \item Display element 2 of {\tt a}.
{\color{red} 
<<>>=
a[2]
@
}
 \item Display element 4 of {\tt a}.
{\color{red} 
<<>>=
a[4]
@
}
 \item Calculate the product of elements 2 and 4 of {\tt a}.
{\color{red} 
<<>>=
a[2] * a[4]
@
}
 \item Assign the integers 3 and 4 to object {\tt b} and use {\tt b} to select elements 3 and 4 of object {\tt a}.
{\color{red}
<<>>=
b <- c(3, 4)
# or
b <- 3:4
a[b]
@
}
 \item Display every element of {\tt a} except element 2. 
{\color{red} 
<<>>=
a[-2]
@
}
\item Display every element of {\tt a} except elements 3 and 4. 
{\color{red} 
<<>>=
a[-c(3:4)]
@
}
\item Display only those elements of {\tt a} that are greater than or equal to 6.
{\color{red} 
<<>>=
a[a >= 6]
@
}
\item Display only those elements of {\tt a} that are not equal to 7.
{\color{red} 
<<>>=
a[a != 7]
@
}
\item Use the {\tt list} function to create an object {\tt ab} which is a list of the two objects {\tt a} and {\tt b}.
{\color{red} 
<<>>=
ab <- list(a, b)
@
}
\item Display {\tt ab}.
{\color{red} 
<<>>=
ab
@
}
\item Change the names of the elements in {\tt ab} to ``a'' and ``b''.
{\color{red} 
<<>>=
names(ab) <- c("a", "b")
@
}
\item Display {\tt ab} again. What has changed?
{\color{red} 
<<>>=
ab
@
\noindent Displaying {\tt ab} now shows {\tt \$a} and {\tt \$b} in place of the original {\tt [[1]]} and {\tt [[2]]}. This indicates how to select and subset the list when we have names versus having no names.}
\item Create this matrix {\tt m}:
<<>>=
m <- matrix(1:9, nrow=3, byrow=T)
m
@
 Why are the numbers 1, 2, and 3 in the first row and not the first column? 

{\color{red} \noindent Because we set the argument {\tt byrow} equal to TRUE.  
}
 \item Display the element on the second row and second column of {\tt m}.
{\color{red} 
<<>>=
m[2, 2]
@
}
 \item Display only the 2nd row of {\tt m}.
{\color{red} 
<<>>=
m[2, ]
@
}
 \item Display only the 3rd column of {\tt m}.
{\color{red} 
<<>>=
m[, 3]
@
}
 \item Display only the 2nd and 3rd columns of {\tt m}. Do so in two different ways.
{\color{red} 
<<>>=
m[, 2:3]
m[, -1]
@
}
